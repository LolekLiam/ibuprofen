Ibuprofen is a modern, open-source alternative to the official eAsistent app, focused on speed, reliability, and giving students access to the information they actually need without paywalls.

• View school timetables instantly, even when the official app is down
• Filter schedules by teacher or class (a feature missing in the official app)
• Securely log in with your eAsistent account
• Access your own personalized timetable
• Uses only publicly accessible endpoints
• No tracking, no analytics, no data collection
• Fully open source and privacy-respecting

Ibuprofen is built by students, for students, with a smooth UI, fast performance, and no restrictions.
More features are coming soon, including free grade lookup and upcoming test visibility.
